# Webserver_L1-S2

Website adress to access it (when server is on) :
http://127.0.0.1:2022/cgi-bin/login.py

This was my first attempt on webserver, using python, ending up in some sort of products management website.
You need to start an local server on your computer, sadly, I don't remember how to acheive that hehe.
